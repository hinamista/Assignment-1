The Tomiya Hinami Blog
This is a website about Virtual Youtuber/Virtual Singer (Hinami Tomiya). 
It shows all of her covers and updates on her streaming schedule along with links to social media profiles 
and Behind the Scenes progress in recording/rigging/drawing.

Design Process
For my design process, the target audience is the public consumers of content creation. I focused mainly on the colour scheme and the aesthetics of the website. The soft pink and white helps to create a warm and friendly environment while the blue gradient stays true to the Vtuber's character lore so that the website looks more inviting to fans of the Vtuber and the public audience. The website is easy to navigate and it has a clear and cute design to the viewers so it is not only convenient but pretty.

The following link is for the Adobe XD wireframe that I made before starting to code.

Technologies Used
In this website, I used html, css and a little bit of javascript. 
html - https://html.com (It was used to provide the main structure of the website)
css - https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html (It was used to add aesthetics and make the website look visually appealing)
javascript - https://www.javascript.com (It was used to make the website more interactive to users)

Testing
The way I tested was that I tried out the actual website as a user. It was a form of trial and error.
I ran the website again and again after every change to try and figure out what the problems in the codes were until I finally found the issue. And to fix the issue, I did more trials-and-errors. It was really a lot of experimentations.
