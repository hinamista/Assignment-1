# Assignment-1
The Tomiya Hinami Blog
This is a website about Virtual Youtuber/Virtual Singer (Hinami Tomiya). 
It shows all of her covers and updates on her streaming schedule along with links to social media profiles 
and Behind the Scenes progress in recording/rigging/drawing.

Design Process
For my design process, the target audience is the public consumers of content creation. I focused mainly on the colour scheme and the aesthetics of the website. The soft pink and white helps to create a warm and friendly environment while the blue gradient stays true to the Vtuber's character lore so that the website looks more inviting to fans of the Vtuber and the public audience. The website is easy to navigate and it has a clear and cute design to the viewers so it is not only convenient but pretty.

The following link is for the Adobe XD wireframe that I made before starting to code.

Features Left to Implement

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
